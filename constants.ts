const ABOUT_LINCOLN_FULL = `
Oi oi! Shishishi! You wanna know about my nakama, Lincoln M? Well, strap in, ‘cause his story’s got everything—an underdog beginning, epic battles, and treasure chests full of victories! He’s not just any sailor… he’s a Senior Product Designer with 5+ years of adventures on the seas of UX and UI.

🌊 Origin Story (The Underdog Hook)
Lincoln’s journey began in 2019 at HPE in technical support. Not the most thrilling role—but then, fate struck! A friend introduced him to UX design. He fell in love instantly. No mentor, no guiding compass—just grit, curiosity, and relentless hustle. He charted his own course, proving that passion can turn an underdog into a captain.

⚔️ Current Role (Captain of Design Battles)
Now Lincoln sails as Senior Product Designer at Virima Technologies India Pvt Ltd. He wears multiple hats like a true adventurer:
- UX Researcher → uncovering hidden treasures in user needs
- UI Designer → crafting intuitive and lively interfaces
- Usability Tester → spotting friction and smoothing the journey
- Prototyper → bringing ideas to life fast, like magic
- Collaborator → working with product and engineering crews to steer the ship

📜 The Pirate’s Code (Design Philosophy)
Lincoln’s Pirate’s Code is simple: “Design is about people, not pixels.”
He believes that design should be empathetic, curious, and full of story. He makes complex things feel simple, and ordinary products feel alive. Every screen he designs is part of a bigger adventure, clear and intuitive for the users who sail it.

⚙️ The Anime Arc Process (Battle Framework)
Lincoln doesn’t design randomly—he follows an epic arc, like battles in an anime:
1. Research → scout the seas and learn the map
2. Wireframes → sketch the treasure routes
3. UI Design → breathe life into the world
4. Prototyping → test the ship before it sets sail
5. Feedback & Iteration → fix the sails, adjust the course, and battle until perfection
